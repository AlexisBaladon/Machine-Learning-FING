### Main functionalities:

- Pull from gmail: As the used datasets was tested with private mails, the program provides with the required functionalities to concurrently download your mails from gmail, provided that a valid  crendentials.json file is contained in the "google" directory.


- NaiveBayes class: Uses the functions fit and predict to train and predict the classification of a given dataset. Additionally, the class provides the option to only count repeated words twice.


- Preprocessing: Tokenizes, stems and removes stopwords and punctuation marks from the dataset. Moreover, the module provides the option of reducing the size of the dataset as well as the length of each set of words.


- Word cloud: The program uses the homonym library to recompile images with the most repeated words for each classification.


To run the program it is necessary to open the the "tarea3.ipynb" jupyter notebook.
